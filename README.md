A calculator with self-coded logic for the operations, created as an introduction to React and a refresh of JavaScript.
Based on the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgRrrOt0Vr8&list=WL&index=10

Improvements and own functions:
- Added SYNTAX ERROR.
- Button for inverting the current number to positive or negative (+/-), which in turn makes it possible to do calculations with two negative numbers.
- Now correctly handles decimals.
- Modeled after the iPhone calculator, but with the single-digit delete function replacing the % function, which is more useful in my opinion.
- Using empty strings instead of null and stricter indentation.
- A pleasant use of colors and design.

Stack:
- Vite + React app
- Run with:
  - cd calc
  - npm run dev 

This project is currently finished, but there is great learning opportunity in building a calculator with advanced functions and an expandable grid, like the one on a phone.
